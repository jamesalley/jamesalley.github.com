<h1>James Alley's Github stuff.</h1>

<p>I work at Yahoo! as a Mobile FE Engineer.</p>

<p>I design all my software as YUI modules so that they can be reused by the community, published via the YUI Gallery, or perhaps even absorbed into the YUI core if they prove broadly useful.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<ol>
    <li><a href="../RatioRight/">Ratio Right</a>: Allows for flexible designs which maintain their proportions as they scale.</li>
    <li><a href="../FlickPanel/">Flick Panel</a>: Lets you flick to reveal a sidebar or garage-door type panel.</li>
</ol>

<h1>James Alley's Github stuff.</h1>

<p>I work at Yahoo, currently within the Yahoo Presentation Platforms team (formerly the YUI team).</p>

<p>It's been years since I've updated my personal stuff. I think I'm going to cancel my web-hosting 
plan and just move everything to GitHub pages. But this will take some time.</p>

<p>A few of my old YUI projects, and some CSS components, are listed below.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<ol>
    <li><a href="../RatioRight/">Ratio Right</a>: Allows for flexible designs which maintain their proportions as they scale.</li>
    <li><a href="../FlickPanel/">Flick Panel</a>: Lets you flick to reveal a sidebar or garage-door type panel.</li>
    <li><a href="../TapToTop/">TapToTop</a>: YUI3 plug-in providing a skinnable element which can be tapped to bring the user to the top of the page.</li>
    <li><a href="../CSS-Components/">CSS Components</a>: Useful components, resolution-independent, built using HTML and CSS instead of images.</li>
</ol>
